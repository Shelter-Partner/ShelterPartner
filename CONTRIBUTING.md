# Coming soon

## Code
### Prereqs
- Clone this repo.
- Get a working Flutter development environment set up. For example, open the repo in VSCode, install the Flutter extension (following the steps [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile#use-vs-code-to-install-flutter) in the "Use VS Code to install Flutter" section), and then debug `./Flutter/shelter_partner/lib/main.dart`.

### Formatting
- Please ensure your code is formatted before submitting a pull request. The CI will fail if your code is not formatted.
- You can format your code by running:
  - `cd Flutter/shelter_partner && dart format .` for the main app
  - `cd Website && dart format .` for the website
- You can also set up your IDE (such as VS Code or Android Studio) to automatically format Dart code on save. In VS Code, search for `editor.formatOnSave` in your settings and enable it.
