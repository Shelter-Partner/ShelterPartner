# Testing Standards for ShelterPartner Flutter App

## 1. Test File Organization
- Place all test files in the `test/` directory, mirroring the structure of the `lib/` directory.
- For each Dart file in `lib/`, create a corresponding test file in `test/` (e.g., `lib/views/auth/login_page.dart` â†’ `test/views/auth/login_page_test.dart`).

## 2. Test Naming Conventions
- Name test files with a `_test.dart` suffix.
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested.

## 3. Writing Tests
- Use the `flutter_test` package for widget and unit tests.
- Group related tests using the `group()` function.
- Use `setUp()` and `tearDown()` for test initialization and cleanup.
- Prefer `testWidgets()` for widget tests and `test()` for pure Dart logic.

## 4. Mocking Strategy & Generation
- **Create mocks locally in each test file** to make dependencies clear and explicit.
- Use the `mockito` package with `@GenerateMocks` annotation at the top of test files.
  ```dart
  @GenerateMocks([YourRepository, AnotherService])
  ```
- After defining your mocks, run the following command to generate the necessary mock files:
  ```bash
  dart run build_runner build
  # Clean and regenerate if needed
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```
- Create mock instances in `setUp()` for clarity and proper initialization.
- For Firebase services:
    - Use `fake_cloud_firestore` for Firestore.
    - Use `mockito` for Firebase Auth. You can define a mock like this:
      ```dart
      class MockFirebaseAuth extends Mock implements FirebaseAuth {}
      ```
- Only mock HTTP clients when testing repository implementations or specific network scenarios.

## 5. Widget Testing Best Practices

### Test Helper Functions
Create reusable helper functions to reduce boilerplate.  
*See existing test files for examples.*

### Widget Test Structure
Follow a consistent structure for widget tests.  
*See existing test files for examples.*

## 6. Test Effectiveness Validation
**CRITICAL: Always verify that your tests can fail when the code they're testing is broken.**

This is essential to ensure your tests are actually testing the intended behavior and will catch regressions.

### Validation Process
After writing a test that passes, temporarily break the functionality and verify the test fails:

1. **For UI tests**: Change the text, remove UI elements, or modify widget properties
2. **For behavior tests**: Remove callbacks, change method calls, or alter logic
3. **For integration tests**: Break the data flow or remove key functionality

### Why This Matters
- **Prevents false security**: Tests that never fail provide false confidence
- **Catches test bugs**: Ensures your test setup and assertions are correct
- **Validates test scope**: Confirms you're testing the right behavior
- **Improves reliability**: Helps identify flaky or ineffective tests

## 7. Running Tests
- Run all tests with `flutter test` from the project root.
- **Before submitting code**: Ensure all tests pass AND verify that critical tests can fail when the code they test is broken.
