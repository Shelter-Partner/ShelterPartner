# Overview of the `lib` Directory

The `lib` directory contains the core source code for the Flutter application. It is organized to promote a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

## Subdirectories:

-   **`helper/`**: Contains utility classes and functions that provide reusable logic across different parts of the application.

-   **`models/`**: Defines the data structures and object schemas for the application. These classes represent the core entities the application works with. See `models/README.md` for more details on their characteristics in this project.

-   **`repositories/`**: Houses classes that abstract and manage access to the application's data sources. They handle data retrieval, storage, and other data-related operations. See `repositories/README.md` for specifics on their implementation.

-   **`view_models/`**: Contains classes that act as intermediaries between the UI (`views`) and the data (`models`). They manage UI state, handle business logic, and prepare data for presentation. See `view_models/README.md` for a detailed explanation.

-   **`views/`**: Includes all UI elements, such as pages, components, and widgets that make up the user interface. See `views/README.md` for more on their structure and responsibilities.

## Key Files Directly within `lib/`:

-   **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the Flutter application, responsible for initializing the app, setting up primary navigation, and defining the core application widget.
-   **`firebase_options.dart`**: Contains Firebase project configuration options, auto-generated by FlutterFire, and used to connect the app to the correct Firebase project on different platforms.
-   **`firebase_service.dart`**: A service class that encapsulates the Firebase initialization logic, ensuring Firebase is set up correctly when the application starts.

This structure is designed to make the codebase easier to navigate, understand, and scale.
