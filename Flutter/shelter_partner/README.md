# shelter_partner

This is the Flutter project for Shelter Partner.

## How to Run the Flutter App

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed (ensure `flutter` is in your PATH)
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- (Optional) [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Flutter extension, or Android Studio

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in this directory and run:

```
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Run the App
You can run the app on any supported platform (web, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux). For example:

- **Web**:
  ```
  flutter run -d chrome
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```
  flutter run -d windows
  ```
- **Android** (emulator or device):
  ```
  flutter run -d android
  ```
- **iOS** (Mac only):
  ```
  flutter run -d ios
  ```

Or, use your IDE's built-in Flutter run/debug functionality.

### 3. Troubleshooting
- Make sure you have a device or emulator running for your target platform.
- If you encounter issues, run `flutter doctor` and follow the suggestions.
