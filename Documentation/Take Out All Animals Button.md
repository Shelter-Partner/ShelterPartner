The buttons "Take Out All Dogs" or "Take Out All Cats" in the Additional Options view allows you to quickly select all of the animals that are pulled up on the screen. This can save time after searching or filtering by categories when you want to select to take out all of those animals at the same time. For example, this is helpful when doing playgroups so that you don't have to take each animal out manually. To put them all back at the same time, you simply click "Put Back All Visible Dogs/Cats".
