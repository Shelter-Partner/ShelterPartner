# FAQs
## How much does it cost?

PawPartner is 100% free. There are no paid subscriptions. There are no in-app purchases. There are no ads. PawPartner is funded entirely by donations.

## How can I start using PawPartner?

  1. Fill out this form: [Get Started](https://pawpartner.app/new-shelter)
  2. We’ll load your account with dummy data and email your login credentials so that you can test out the app without having to connect your management software.
  3. If you would like to use PawPartner in your shelter, simply shoot us an email, and we’ll send you more information on how to connect your management software.

## How would you recommend using PawPartner in my shelter?

We recommend using PawPartner on a shelter owned iPad. Ideally, it would be mounted on a wall or somewhere that volunteers can easily access. Make sure that “Admin Mode” is turned on and that you enable [Guided Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3OQxJV8atQ) on your iPad. We have recently added “Volunteer Accounts” that allow users to access a restricted version of the app on their phones with their own login. But because it’s not yet available on Android, this isn’t yet the recommended way to use the app as it excludes Android users.

## Is PawPartner available on Android?

Unfortunately PawPartner is not available on Android. We plan to support Android in the future.

## What management software works with PawPartner?

PawPartner can connect to any of the following accounts; Shelter Manager (ASM), ShelterLuv, RescueGroups, and Shelter Buddy. It cannot not connect to PetPoint or Chameleon. We hope to be able to connect to these in the future. If you use software not mentioned, it may still be possible to connect your account. Just let me know via email and I’ll see what I can do.

## PawPartner is missing something that my shelter would need to be able to use it. Can you add this feature?

Most likely yes! Feel free to email me at jared@pawpartner.app with your situation, and I’ll see what I can do to make PawPartner work with your shelter. You can also submit feature requests on the Kanban page of the website.

## How can I stay up to date with new features and improvements to PawPartner?

The Kanban page on the website is a live view of my to-do list. You can see what I plan to work on, what I’m currently working on, and what I’ve recently finished here. You can also submit feature requests.
