The Search Bar allows you to search for animals by many different categories, including: names, notes, tags, sex, breed, location, description, take out alert, put back alert, adoption category, behavior category, location category, medical category, and volunteer category. For more complex searches or ones that you want to remain in effect after refreshing the page, you can use the User Enrichment Filter.
