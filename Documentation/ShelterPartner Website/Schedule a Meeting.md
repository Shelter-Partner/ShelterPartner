# Schedule a meeting
Because of limited resources, it’s hard to keep the tutorials and documentation up to date with all the new features. Many shelters have prefered to do a video chat to understand how ShelterPartner can be integrated into their shelter. You can schedule a video chat with me below. I’m looking forward to meeting you!
