Selecting the Enrichment Tab allows volunteers to see all the animals in the shelter. Each animal has a card with it's name, photo, where it is located, details about the animal, when they were last taken out and previous notes and logs. Volunteers can view these as well as add to them. This is where they will document their experiences with the animals. 

In the Enrichment Tab view, they can also select Additional Options which allows them to choose to engage Simplistic Mode, search for or filter the animals in multiple ways, or select to "Take Out All Visible Dogs/Cats".

To take out the animal, simply long tap on the animal's card. To put the animal back, long tap on it again. By default, the animal's taken out most recently will then go to the bottom of the page. Many items in this view can be customized to your liking by changing your settings.
