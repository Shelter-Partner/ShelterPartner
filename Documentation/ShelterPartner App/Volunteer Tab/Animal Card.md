Each animal is represented by an animal card. Each card contains the animal's name, their photo, their location, their log history, and popular tags if they have any. Additional information can be included on the animals card upon request, such as behavior category or volunteer group. To take an animal out of their kennel, long tap on their photo until their card turns orange. To put them back in their kennel, long tap on their photo until their card turns blue. By tapping the ellipsis, you can view the animals [Detail Sheet](Detail%20Sheet.md), add photos and notes via a [QR Code](QR%20Code%20Option.md), or [add notes directly](Add%20Note%20View.md) in the app.
