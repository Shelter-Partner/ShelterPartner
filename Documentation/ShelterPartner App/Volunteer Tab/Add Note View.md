To add notes to an animal's profile, click on the ellipses next to an animal's name. This will bring up a dropdown menu from which you can select 'Add Note'. Use this space to add notes about an animal's temperament, behavior on a walk, or other anecdotes. The information you provide will be used to populate the 'Volunteer Notes' section of an animal's detail sheet. If your shelter makes use of tags, select the relevant tags from those listed on this page. Click 'Save Note' to return to the main dashboard.
