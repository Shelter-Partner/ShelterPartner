Itâ€™s highly customizable and connects directly to management software like ShelterLuv for animals and Better Impact to sync with your volunteers. If you are interested in using ShelterPartner, I would recommend waiting until January 1, 2025 to sign up. This is when version 2 will be released. Version 2 is a rework of the app built from scratch. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at jared@shelterpartner.org.',
