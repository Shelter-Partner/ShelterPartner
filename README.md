# Welcome To [ShelterPartner](https://shelterpartner.org)!

I'm hoping to switch everything to Flutter by the end of the year and scrap the swift and kotlin versions as soon as that's done.

## How To Contribute On GitHub
1. Create an issue in the Some-Apps/ShelterPartner repository or select an existing issue. Issues that I've labeled as "up next" are higher priority but you're welcome to work on anything even if it isn't marked as "up next".
2. Comment on the issue that you would like to work on it
3. Once you have been assigned the issue, fork to the repository into a branch containing the issue number
4. When you are ready, submit a pull request from this branch
5. Your code will be reviewed and then either be approved or have changes requested
6. Once the pull request has been approved, you can safely delete your branch and start on a new issue.

Feel free to use your issue thread to communicate. Contributors will only be assigned one issue at a time.

Here are the login credentials for you local build but if you're using Flutter, create your own shelter account as the data structure is slightly different.

## File Organization
Follow MVVM repository architecture. For example:

```plaintext
lib/
  models/
    animal.dart
  views/
    pages/
      volunteer_page.dart
    components/
      animal_card_view.dart
  view_models/
    animals_view_model.dart
  repositories/
    animal_repository.dart
```


## Contributor Incentives

### Gather Account (1 issue per month)
Contributors who make an average of 1 approved pull request or more per month will be given a desk in a [virtual office building](https://gather.town). This will allow you to interact with other contributors while you work or just talk and play online mini games. An invite will be sent after your first contribution. From there, if you don't make a contribution for at least 2 months in a row, the invite will be revoked. But if you make another contribution, the invite will be sent again.

### Github Copilot (5 issues per month)
Contributors who make 5 approved pull requests or more per month will be given access to github copilot. An invite will be sent after your 3rd contribution in a month. From there, if you don't make 5 contributions per month for at least 2 months in a row, the invite will be revoked. The invite will be sent again after your 5th contribution in a month.

### ChatGPT (50 issues per year)
Contributors who make 50 approved pull requests in the past 12 months will be given an annual ChatGPT subscription. This will be reasssed the following year before it renews.
